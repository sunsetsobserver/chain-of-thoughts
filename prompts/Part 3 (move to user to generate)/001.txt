METER: 3/4

TITLE
Part 3 — Bars 1–4 — Cloud Loop A (pp), low density, gentle taper.

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
[alto_flute, bass_clarinet, trumpet, violin, cello, double_bass].
Monophony per instrument (no chords).

SAFE OPS (ENGINE-FRIENDLY)
• TIME / DURATION / VELOCITY / METER: use `add` only (integers). Do NOT use `mul`/`div`. When N>1 for TIME, never use add 0.
• PITCH: use `add` or `subtract` only (integers). Stay in hard ranges.

SECTION POLICY (applies to EACH of Bars 1–4)
• Dynamic: pp ≈ 28–34 per note.
• Density per instrument per bar:
  – winds/violin/cello: 2–4 notes;
  – trumpet/double_bass: 1–3 notes (sparser).
• TIME: strictly increasing steps from {1,2,3,4}; avoid heavy vertical alignments between parts.
• DURATION: values in {1,2,3,4}; aim to fit gaps (runner will cap to next onset/bar end).
• PITCH: add/sub only within Aggregate A band pcs; seed near tessitura center; net drift per line per bar in [−2..+2]; stay inside hard ranges.
• VELOCITY: stable pp; small stepwise changes (±2 max).
• METER: seeds set numerator=3, denominator=4; transforms add 0.

AGGREGATE A (INTERNAL, DO NOT PRINT)
Construct a fresh register-partitioned, non-isomorphic aggregate for Bars 1–4:
• For each instrument, split its playable MIDI range into LOW / MID / HIGH (contiguous, full coverage).
• Assign 3–4 ordered pcs to each band; bands are disjoint and LOW∪MID∪HIGH = {0..11}.
• Order within each band suggests thirdal/quartal neighborhoods; avoid trivial 0–3–6–9 cycles.

OPTIONAL TEXTURAL DETAIL
In at most one of the four bars, allow a brief 1–2 tick “flutter” (staccato pair) by one instrument; keep it pp; separate onsets (still monophonic).

HARD RANGES (MIDI)
af 53..81 • bcl 43..74 • tpt 60..82 • vn 55..88 • vc 48..74 • db 31..55

STRUCTURE OF THE RETURN
Return one JSON object with "bars":[ … ] containing four 3/4 bars (ticks 0..11 each).

VALIDATION
Monophony per instrument; time steps {1..4} strictly increasing; last note ends ≤ 12; duration ∈ {1,2,3,4}; pitch in range and band pcs; avoid heavy vertical alignments; optional flutter appears in at most one bar and by only one instrument.
