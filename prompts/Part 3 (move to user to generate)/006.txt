METER: 4/4

TITLE
Part 3 — Bar 18 — Cadence B: two half-bar tutti chords (renewed color).

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
[alto_flute, bass_clarinet, trumpet, violin, cello, double_bass]. Monophony per instrument.

SAFE OPS (ENGINE-FRIENDLY)
• TIME / DURATION / VELOCITY / METER: `add` only; no `mul`/`div`.
• PITCH: `add`/`subtract` only.

PT REALIZATION (exact, single bar)
• TIME: exactly two onsets at ticks [0, 8] (N=2). Implement as seed time=0 with time.add 8.
• DURATION: [8, 8] — seed dur=8 with duration.add 0.
• PITCH: add/sub only; center-weighted voicing; on Hit 2, at least two instruments change octave or neighbor pc vs Hit 1; avoid adjacent-instrument unisons; sparse octaves OK.
• VELOCITY: strong tutti ≈ 112 (constant; velocity.add 0).
• METER: seeds numerator=4, denominator=4; transforms add 0.

VALIDATION
Exactly two notes per instrument at [0,8] with durations [8,8]; last ends ≤ 16; spacing rules observed.
