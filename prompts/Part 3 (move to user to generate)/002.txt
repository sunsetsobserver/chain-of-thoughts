METER: 3/4

TITLE
Part 3 — Bars 5–8 — Response Loop A: ppp bed + triumphant trumpet melody on top.

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
[alto_flute, bass_clarinet, trumpet, violin, cello, double_bass].
Monophony per instrument (no chords).

SAFE OPS (ENGINE-FRIENDLY)
• TIME / DURATION / VELOCITY / METER: `add` only; no `mul`/`div`; when N>1 for TIME, never add 0.
• PITCH: `add`/`subtract` only.

AGGREGATE R-A (INTERNAL, DO NOT PRINT)
Construct a new aggregate for Bars 5–8 (materially different from Aggregate A: change ≥ 6 pcs→band assignments across the ensemble and shift ≥ 1 band boundary for ≥ 2 instruments).

PT REALIZATION

Trumpet (triumphant melody)
• TIME: strictly increasing using steps from {1,2,3,4}; 4–8 notes per bar (varied).
• DURATION: values in {1,2,3,4}; fit gaps (runner caps).
• PITCH: through-composed line across Bars 5–8; favor MID↔HIGH; avoid >3 same-direction steps; net drift per bar in [−2..+2]; band-legal pcs; hard-range legal.
• VELOCITY: forte ≈ 108–116 (small arcs allowed, step Δ ≤ 8).
• METER: seeds numerator=3, denominator=4; transforms add 0.

All other instruments (ppp bed)
• TIME: steps {1,2,3,4}; 3–6 notes per bar; keep loose against the trumpet (avoid frequent exact coincidences).
• DURATION: {1,2,3,4}; monophony.
• PITCH: add/sub within R-A band pcs; seed near tessitura center; mainly stepwise with occasional corrective leaps (±5, ±7, ±12) that return to steps; hard-range legal.
• VELOCITY: ppp ≈ 22 (±2).
• METER: seeds 3/4; transforms add 0.

VARIATION WITHIN LOOP A
For each non-trumpet instrument, avoid literal copy of Bars 1–4 onset patterns; include at least one different duration value per instrument/bar.

VALIDATION
Exactly four 3/4 bars; time streams strictly increase; durations fit gaps; last note ends ≤ 12; trumpet ≈ 108–116 vs others ppp ≈ 22; band pcs + hard ranges respected.
