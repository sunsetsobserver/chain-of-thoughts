METER: 3/4

TITLE
Part 3 — Bars 14–17 — Response Loop B: ppp bed + triumphant trumpet (varied).

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
[alto_flute, bass_clarinet, trumpet, violin, cello, double_bass].

SAFE OPS (ENGINE-FRIENDLY)
• TIME / DURATION / VELOCITY / METER: `add` only; when N>1 for TIME, never add 0; no `mul`/`div`.
• PITCH: `add`/`subtract` only.

AGGREGATE R-B (INTERNAL)
Derive a new aggregate for Bars 14–17, materially different from R-A (≥ 6 pcs reassigned across ensemble and ≥ 1 band boundary shift for ≥ 2 instruments).

PT REALIZATION
Follow Response Loop A rules: trumpet forte through-line; others ppp interlocking; time steps {1,2,3,4}; durations {1,2,3,4}; pitch add/sub within bands; monophony.

VARIATION constraint
For each non-trumpet instrument and bar, avoid literal onset copies of Bars 5–8; include at least one different duration value.

METER / RANGES / VALIDATION
Same as earlier 3/4 prompts.

OUTPUT
One JSON object with "bars":[ … ] for four bars (14–17).
