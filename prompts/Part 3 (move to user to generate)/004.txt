METER: 3/4

TITLE
Part 3 — Bars 10–13 — Cloud Loop B (pp), varied reprise.

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
[alto_flute, bass_clarinet, trumpet, violin, cello, double_bass].
Monophony per instrument.

SAFE OPS (ENGINE-FRIENDLY)
• TIME / DURATION / VELOCITY / METER: `add` only; when N>1 for TIME, never add 0; no `mul`/`div`.
• PITCH: `add`/`subtract` only.

SECTION POLICY (each bar)
Same density/timing/duration/velocity rules as Cloud Loop A, but build Aggregate B anew (new pcs→band mapping; adjust ≥ 1 band boundary for ≥ 3 instruments). Keep textures airy; avoid frequent vertical alignments.

VARIATION vs Bars 1–4
For every instrument and bar, avoid literal onset copies; include at least one different duration value per instrument/bar.

HARD RANGES / METER
Ranges as before; meter seeds 3/4; transforms add 0.

OUTPUT
Return one JSON object with "bars":[ … ] for four bars (10–13).
