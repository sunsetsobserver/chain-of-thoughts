TITLE
Bar 2 — Two tutti verticals from two fresh register-partitioned aggregates (contrast with Bar 1).

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
Use these six instruments and no others:
[alto_flute, violin, bass_clarinet, trumpet, cello, double_bass].
Every instrument must sound on BOTH verticals; still monophonic per instrument.

MUSICAL TECHNIQUE (WHAT TO CONSTRUCT INTERNALLY — DO NOT PRINT IT)
Design two distinct register-partitioned, non-isomorphic aggregates, call them A and B. Realize them purely via PT design (pitch/time/duration/velocity). Do not output the aggregates — only the PT bundle.

Aggregate A and B (both must satisfy):
• Partition register into three contiguous bands (LOW / MID / HIGH) over the playable MIDI range.
• Assign to each band a disjoint pitch-class set (pcs) of exactly 4 pcs; LOW_pcs ∪ MID_pcs ∪ HIGH_pcs = all 12 pcs (0..11).
• The order of pcs within each band matters (defines neighborhood for targeting), and the pcs should suggest thirdal/quartal neighborhoods (avoid trivial equal-step cycles like 0–3–6–9).
• A and B must be different (at least one band uses a different pcs set and/or different band spans).
• Contrast with Bar 1 (choose pcs so the sonority palette is perceptibly different; you won’t see Bar 1’s exact sets, so bias away from common diatonic triadic clusters).

VOICING RULES (HOW TO REALIZE THE TWO HITS WITH PTs)
We will create exactly two simultaneous verticals (tutti chords) at relative bar ticks 0 and 4, each with duration 4 ticks (quarter notes on a 1/16 grid). No other notes in this bar.

For EACH instrument:
1) Determine its band for voicing by using the instrument’s tessitura center (LOW/MID/HIGH).
2) Hit 1 (tick 0, dur 4): choose one pitch-class from Aggregate A’s pcs for that band, then snap to the nearest legal MIDI inside the instrument’s range around tessitura center.
3) Hit 2 (tick 4, dur 4): choose a pitch-class from Aggregate B’s pcs for that band, not equal to the first hit’s pc for that same instrument; target a nearby register (±3 semitones window is fine), then snap to the nearest legal MIDI inside range for Aggregate B.
4) Avoid unisons across adjacent instruments on each hit (mild constraint); octave doublings are acceptable but keep them sparse.
5) Keep voicings center-weighted (db/cello anchor LOW, bcl/cello share LOW↔MID, vn/af/tpt occupy MID↔HIGH).

DYNAMICS
Two fixed dynamic levels for clarity of contrast:
• Hit 1 velocity ≈ 124 (stronger)
• Hit 2 velocity ≈ 114 (slightly softer)

PT REALIZATION REQUIREMENTS (so the bundle reproduces the behavior)
• TIME: strictly increasing using only `add {1,2,3,4}`. For exactly two onsets at 0 and 4, use a single-step pattern that yields `[0,4]` (e.g., seed time=0, transforms `[{"name":"add","args":[4]}]` with `N=2`). No zeros; no mul/div.
• DURATION: constant 4; values must stay in `{1,2,3,4}` and obey MAX(duration) ≤ s_min (here `s_min = 4`).
• PITCH: add/sub only. Realize the two chosen targets by setting `seed pitch = Hit1_MIDI` and a single transform whose delta lands exactly on Hit 2 (delta = Hit2_MIDI − Hit1_MIDI).
• VELOCITY: two values `[124, 114]` (e.g., seed 124 then `add -10`).
• METER: seeds must set numerator=2, denominator=4; numerator/denominator transforms are constant `add 0`.

TEXTURE CHECKS
• Exactly two notes per instrument; both verticals are tutti; no extra events.
• All MIDI pitches must be inside each instrument’s hard range and on a band-legal pcs for the respective aggregate and register.
• Notes must end at or before tick 8.

FORM FOR THIS PROMPT
Return one bundle with exactly six features (one per listed instrument) and a run_plan that produces:
– time onsets `[0,4]`,
– duration `[4,4]`,
– pitch realized from Aggregate A then B as above,
– velocity `[124,114]`,
while respecting the PT op constraints.
