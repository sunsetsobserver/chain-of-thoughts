# Part 2 (Bars 16–30) — Robust “Literal Repeat” Prompt

METER: 3/4
Ticks per bar: 12 (quarter=4, half=8, dotted half=12)

TASK OVERVIEW
Return one JSON object for exactly 15 bars (conceptual Bars 16–30). Instruments per bar in this exact order:
["alto_flute","violin","bass_clarinet","trumpet","cello","double_bass"].

• Strings (violin, cello, double_bass): literal repeat of Bars 1–15 (bar-by-bar mapping below).
• Winds (alto_flute, bass_clarinet): new, homophonic group with their own per-bar rhythm from the allowed set.
• Trumpet: tacet placeholder as specified.

AUTHORITATIVE REFERENCE (DO NOT ALTER A SINGLE NUMBER)
The following JSON is the ground truth for Bars 1–15. You will reuse the strings’ pt.dimensions arrays and run_plan.seeds from here, unchanged (only pt.name must be new). Treat this block as read-only source of truth:

<<<REFERENCE_STRINGS_JSON_START>>>
PASTE THE ENTIRE BARS 1–15 JSON HERE
<<<REFERENCE_STRINGS_JSON_END>>>

LITERAL REPEAT MAPPING (exact copy of numbers)
Map prior bars → current bars for strings only:

• Bar 16 ← reference Bar 1
• Bar 17 ← reference Bar 2
• …
• Bar 30 ← reference Bar 15

For each of violin, cello, double_bass in bar k (16–30):
• Copy the entire pt.dimensions array from the mapped reference bar (same order, same transform names and args).
• Copy the exact run_plan.seeds object (time, duration(s), pitch, velocity, numerator, denominator) and N.
• Assign a fresh pt.name (e.g., append _b16, _b17, …).
• No other changes are allowed for strings.

RHYTHM & GROUPED HOMOPHONY
• Within each group, all instruments share the same onsets/durations in that bar.
  – Strings: enforced by the literal copy.
  – Winds: choose one pattern per bar; alto_flute and bass_clarinet must match it exactly.
• Between groups: rhythms may differ.

ALLOWED WIND RHYTHMS (per bar; align to ticks {0,4,8}; single sustained notes only—no chained quarters)
• Dotted half — N=1, onset 0, duration 12.
• Half + Quarter — N=2, onsets 0 & 8; durations 8 & 4.
• Quarter + Half — N=2, onsets 0 & 4; durations 4 & 8.
• Half + Quarter rest — N=1, onset 0, duration 8.
• Quarter rest + Half — N=1, onset 4, duration 8 (set seeds.time = 4).
Rests are realized by omitting events.

TRUMPET (TACET PLACEHOLDER)
Per bar include a single silent event: N=1, seeds.time ≈ 11, duration = 1, velocity = 0; meter seeds 3/4; numerator/denominator transforms = add 0.

RANGES (hard limits — stay inside)
• alto_flute: 53..81
• violin: 55..88
• bass_clarinet: 43..74
• trumpet: 60..82
• cello: 48..74
• double_bass: 31..55

HARMONY NOTES
Winds enrich vertically with post-tonal/jazz colors (added 2/9, 4/11, 6/13, 7; quartal/quintal), with smooth voice-leading and readable spacing. Avoid blatant parallel perfect 5ths with the double_bass across successive changes.

SCHEMA REQUIREMENTS (strict)
• Top-level: "bars": [ … ] with exactly 15 bars (Bars 16–30).
• Each bar has exactly six features, in this exact instrument order:
  ["alto_flute","violin","bass_clarinet","trumpet","cello","double_bass"].
• Each feature’s pt.dimensions list has six entries in this order:
  1) time, 2) duration, 3) pitch, 4) velocity, 5) numerator (add 0), 6) denominator (add 0).
• Include a run_plan with six entries, one per feature; run_plan[i].feature_name must equal that feature’s pt.name.
• All meter seeds set numerator=3, denominator=4.
• Last onset + duration ≤ 12 ticks in every feature.

PRECEDENCE LADDER (resolve conflicts in this order)
1. Exact numeric copy for strings from the REFERENCE block (bar mapping)
2. Schema/order requirements
3. Hard ranges
4. Group homophony rules
5. Wind harmony/style guidance

MANDATORY SELF-CHECK BEFORE RETURNING
• Count bars == 15. If not, regenerate.
• For every string feature in Bars 16–30, confirm that its pt.dimensions array and run_plan (N + seeds) match bit-for-bit the mapped reference bar (except pt.name). If any mismatch, regenerate until identical.
• Winds: confirm grouped homophony per bar and allowed rhythm usage only.
• Trumpet: confirm tacet placeholder spec per bar.
• All pitches within hard ranges; last onset+duration ≤ 12.

OUTPUT
Return one JSON object only (no prose).
