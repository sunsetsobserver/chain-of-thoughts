METER: 3/4

TITLE
Part 2 — Continuation (Bars 12–22): strings repeat (exactly) the material they played in the previous 11 bars; winds enter as a second homophonic group with their own phrasing. Post-tonal color blending tonal and jazz harmony into a 12-tone aware palette, with thirdal/quartal tendencies and tasteful extensions (2/9, 4/11, 5, 6/13, 7 where musical). The two groups form a soft dialogue, enriching the vertical harmony.

FORCES
Two independent homophonic groups:
• Strings: violin, cello, double_bass (repeat the idea from Bars 1–11 exactly).
• Winds: alto_flute, bass_clarinet (new group; same rhythmic vocabulary as strings but their own rhythm per bar).
• Trumpet tacet = silent (placeholder only; see TACET IMPLEMENTATION).

TEXTURE (GROUPED HOMOPHONY)
• Within each group, the instruments always share the same rhythm in a bar (identical onsets and durations for that bar); if there’s a rest segment, all three (violin, cello, double_bass) or two (alto_flute, bass_clarinet) in that group rest for that segment.
• Between groups, rhythms differ (independent choices each bar) to create a gentle call-and-response. Keep the overall surface calm; avoid clutter.

RHYTHMS (per group, choose freely per bar; variety; no two identical bars in a row unless musically justified)
Align events to the quarter grid (bar ticks 0, 4, 8). Allowed patterns:

1. Dotted half (fills the bar).
2. Half + Quarter.
3. Quarter + Half.
4. Half + Quarter rest.
5. Quarter rest + Half.

REALIZATION OF THESE RHYTHMS (simple and strict)
• Quarter = 4 ticks, Half = 8, Dotted half = 12 (as duration add values).
• Use single notes with the correct durations (do not chain quarters to fake a half or dotted half).
• N equals the number of notes actually played by that instrument in the bar (1 or 2).
• Rests: simply omit those events (no silent notes needed inside the bar).

RHYTHM→PT MAPPING (3/4, BAR_TICKS = 12)
• Quarter = 4 ticks, Half = 8, Dotted half = 12 (used as duration values).
• Write exactly the number of musical events in the bar (N = 1 or 2). Use single sustained notes (no chained quarters).
Patterns:
1) Dotted half — N=1, onset 0, duration 12.
2) Half + Quarter — N=2, onsets 0 and 8, durations 8 and 4 (time adds: [8]).
3) Quarter + Half — N=2, onsets 0 and 4, durations 4 and 8 (time adds: [4]).
4) Half + Quarter rest — N=1, onset 0, duration 8 (you may include a harmless extra `add` in time; with N=1 no extra onset is realized).
5) Quarter rest + Half — N=1, onset 4, duration 8 (set seeds.time = 4; you may include a harmless extra `add`).
Rests are realized by omitting events (no silent notes). Do not simulate sustains by repeating the same pitch on 4-tick segments.

HARMONY & VOICING (vertical richness, smooth motion)
• Strings repeat what they played in Bars 1–11,
• Winds (alto_flute and bass_clarinet) contribute complementary upper-structure colors (added 2/9, 4/11, 6/13, 7, quartal/quintal trichords, or gentle tensions) that work vertically with the strings at every change; avoid crude doublings unless used for emphasis (post-tonal/jazz palette with thirdal/quartal flavor and tasteful extensions).
• Aim for clear voice-leading (mostly stepwise in upper parts, small leaps allowed), comfortable spacing, and avoid blatant parallel perfect fifths with the bass across successive changes.
• Let the winds’ phrase design be independent but musically conversational with the strings (e.g., answer after a string change, or hover while strings move, then step forward).
• Trumpet stays silent for the entire fragment.

LITERAL REPEAT (strings)
For Bars 12–22, strings repeat Bars 1–11 exactly, bar-by-bar:
• Bar 12 ← Bar 1, Bar 13 ← Bar 2, …, Bar 22 ← Bar 11.
• Copy the exact `pt.dimensions` arrays and `run_plan.seeds` for violin, cello, double_bass from the earlier PT JSON in context.
• Assign fresh `pt.name` strings (unique) but keep musical content identical.

RANGES (stay inside)
• double_bass: MIDI 28–55 (prefer low–mid).
• cello: MIDI 36–76 (prefer low–mid).
• violin: MIDI 55–100 (prefer mid).
• bass_clarinet: MIDI 38–82 (prefer low–mid).
• alto_flute: MIDI 60–96 (prefer mid–high).
• trumpet: MIDI 55–92 (prefer mid–high).

DYNAMICS (calm arc, balanced dialogue)
Soft sustained character (≈ p to mp). Gentle shaping only. When groups overlap, balance so harmonies read clearly (no aggressive accents).

TACET IMPLEMENTATION (TRUMPET PLACEHOLDER)
For each bar, include trumpet as a silent placeholder to satisfy the six-feature schema: set `N=1`, with a single note near bar end (e.g., time seed around 11), `duration=1`, `velocity=0`; numerator/denominator transforms = add 0.

OUTPUT SCOPE
Generate exactly 11 bars labeled conceptually as Bars 12–22 (meter 3/4). The strings should exactly repeat their material from Bars 1–11 so use exactly the same features for them as before; the winds (alto_flute and bass_clarinet) add independent homophonic phrases per bar.

FINAL OUTPUT (schema essentials)
Return one JSON object with top-level `"bars":[ … ]` containing 11 bars.
Each bar has exactly six features with `meta.instrument` in:
`["alto_flute","violin","bass_clarinet","trumpet","cello","double_bass"]`.
Each feature’s `pt.dimensions` list has exactly six entries in this order (keys & order matter):

```
"dimensions":[
    {"feature_name":"time","transformations":[...]},
    {"feature_name":"duration","transformations":[...]},
    {"feature_name":"pitch","transformations":[...]},
    {"feature_name":"velocity","transformations":[...]},
    {"feature_name":"numerator","transformations":[{"name":"add","args":[0]}]},
    {"feature_name":"denominator","transformations":[{"name":"add","args":[0]}]}
]
```

Include a `run_plan` with six entries (one per feature); `"feature_name"` string-matches the corresponding `pt.name`; meter seeds = 3/4.

Self-check before returning:
• 11 bars present.
• Group homophony holds: within each group (strings; winds) the instruments within one group share identical time/duration per bar.
• Between groups, rhythms may differ but remain from the allowed set; durations are single 4/8/12 values.
• Trumpet is tacet as specified (N=1, near-bar-end, duration=1, velocity=0).
• Strings repeat bars 1-11 exactly.
• Last note per feature ends ≤ 12 ticks; all pitches within the ranges above.
• Vertical harmonies read clearly; winds enrich strings without collisions that obscure the sonority.
