TITLE
Bar 4 — First presentation of the Bars-4–6 aggregate (pp/ppp, center-weighted voicing).

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
Use these six instruments and no others:
[alto_flute, violin, bass_clarinet, trumpet, cello, double_bass].
Everyone plays; monophony per instrument (no chords).

AGGREGATE (INTERNAL, DO NOT PRINT)
Before writing PTs, internally construct a NEW aggregate for Bars 4–6 (NOT reused from Bars 1 or 3):
• Split each instrument’s playable MIDI range into LOW/MID/HIGH bands.
• Assign disjoint pitch-class sets (pcs) to bands; each band has 3–4 pcs; union across the three bands is EXACTLY the 12 pcs (0..11).
• ORDER inside each band matters (thirdal/quartal neighborhoods; avoid equal-step cycles like 0–3–6–9).
• Make this Bars-4–6 aggregate materially different from Bars 1 and 3 (different band boundaries and pcs contents).

Rules:
- pcs_ordered is exactly 4 pcs per band, disjoint across bands; union is all 12 pcs.
- Bands cover the instrument’s playable MIDI range without gaps.
- Choose "id" as a short stable string (e.g., "bars4_6_v1").
- Keep this object compact and valid JSON.

BAR-SPECIFIC PCSET + VOICING TARGETS (INTERNAL GUIDE)
For Bar 4 select ONE bar-pcset (size 5–10) drawn from the union of band pcs;
voicing hint = “spread”; register targets by instrument:

double_bass: LOW, cello: LOW↔MID, bass_clarinet: LOW↔MID,

violin: MID, alto_flute: MID↔HIGH, trumpet: MID↔HIGH.
Avoid unisons between adjacent neighbors; octave doublings okay but sparse.

PT REALIZATION (WHAT TO OUTPUT VIA THE BUNDLE) — ONE sustained bar-long note per instrument
Per instrument:
• TIME: exactly one onset at tick 0 (N=1). Do not create any additional onsets in this bar.
• DURATION: the single note lasts the full bar → 12 ticks. It must end exactly at tick 12.
• PITCH: choose one MIDI near tessitura center that belongs to the bar-pcset and is legal for the instrument’s band at that register. Keep this pitch constant for the entire bar (no pitch changes inside the bar).
• VELOCITY: very soft (pp–ppp): use a seed ≈ 40–48 and keep it constant (tiny deltas ≤2 allowed).
• METER: numerator=3, denominator=4 via seeds; meter transforms are add 0.

VALIDATION
• Exactly one note per instrument in this bar (one onset, one bar-long sustain).
• All MIDI inside hard instrument ranges; chosen pcs legal for the band at that register.
• No overlaps (monophony per instrument holds trivially with N=1).
• The bar-long note ends at or before tick 12 (target = exactly 12).
