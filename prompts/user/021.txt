METER: 4/4

TITLE
Bar 40 — Variation of Bar 6 (two half-note chords A→B with gentle color shift).

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
[alto_flute, violin, bass_clarinet, trumpet, cello, double_bass]. Everyone plays; monophony per instrument.

AGGREGATE REUSE
Reuse Bars 38–40 aggregate. Include "aggregate_signature" (id "bars38_40_v1").

Context rule: For Bars 38–40, include one aggregate_signature at top level with id: "bars38_40_v1". Later bars that reuse it must copy it verbatim from the reference PT JSON context.

PT REALIZATION — two half-note chords
• TIME: onsets [0, 8] (N=2).
• DURATION: [8, 8].
• PITCH: pick chord A (0..8) and chord B (8..16) from the new aggregate’s band pcs; related to the Bar-37 voicing but with small re-spacing/pc substitutions; constant within halves.
• VELOCITY: A ≈ 104–112; B ≈ 84–92 (slightly gentler than Bar 37).
• METER: numerator=4, denominator=4 via seeds; transforms add 0.

VALIDATION
Exactly two notes per instrument; ends at 16; legal ranges; band pcs legal; avoid adjacent-instrument unisons; sparse octaves OK.
(Include "aggregate_signature" unchanged.)
