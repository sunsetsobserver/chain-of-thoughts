METER: 4/4

TITLE
Bars 15–17 — Loop background + accented foreground stabs (continuation of Bars 10–14 plan).

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
Use these six instruments and no others:
[alto_flute, violin, bass_clarinet, trumpet, cello, double_bass].
Monophony per instrument (no chords).

CONTINUITY & SOURCE MATERIAL (INTERNAL, DO NOT PRINT)
This section continues the same technique as Bars 10–14 (background loop plus foreground stabs), adapted for three 4/4 bars (ticks per bar = 16). Keep recognizable continuity with your Bars 10–14 plan (motivic cells, interval flavor, and registral roles), but vary details so it feels like a new paragraph.

ROLE SPLIT (GUIDE, NOT HARD LAW)

* Background loop layer (quiet, continuous-ish): double_bass + cello (+ optional bass_clarinet).
* Foreground stabs (short, accented, color): trumpet, violin, alto_flute (+ optional bass_clarinet sharing stabs sparingly).

REGISTER TARGETS

* double_bass: LOW anchor,
* cello: LOW↔MID, bass_clarinet: LOW↔MID,
* violin: MID, alto_flute: MID↔HIGH, trumpet: MID↔HIGH.
  Avoid adjacent-instrument unisons on the same onset; sparse octave doublings are fine.

DYNAMICS

* Background loop around mp ≈ 48 (gentle, steady).
* Foreground stabs around mf–f ≈ 92 (clearly brighter than the loop).
  Small per-note deviations (±6) allowed for shape; no big swells.

PT REALIZATION — PRECISE TIMING & DURATIONS (applies to each of Bars 16, 17, 18)
Grid: 1/16 ticks; bar length = 16. You must keep monophony strictly (no overlaps per instrument).

1. TIME

   * Use only `add {1,2,3,4}`; strictly increasing onsets; no zeros; no chords.
   * Background loop parts: choose an irregular cell (e.g., 2–3–1–2 …) producing 5–9 onsets spread across the bar with ≤ 1/3 of them aligning with other instruments.
   * Foreground stabs: 2–5 onsets per bar per stab-instrument; do not place them on every beat—prefer syncopation or off-beats for contrast.

2. DURATION

   * Allowed values realized must be in {1,2,3,4}.
   * For monophony safety, ensure MAX(duration) ≤ s_min where `s_min` is that instrument’s smallest time step in this bar.
   * Background loop: mostly 2–4 tick notes (occasionally 1), never overlapping the next onset.
   * Foreground stabs: 1–2 ticks (short, accented), never overlapping the next onset.

3. PITCH

   * `add/sub` only (no mul/div).
   * Stay inside each instrument’s hard range; bias toward each role’s register target above.
   * Background loop lines: small moves (±1, ±2) with occasional corrective leaps (±5, ±7, ±12) that immediately return to stepwise motion. Net drift per bar in [−2..+2].
   * Foreground stabs: pick color pitches that form crunchy, non-triadic verticals against the loop; avoid exact pitch reuse at consecutive stabs for the same instrument.

4. VELOCITY

   * Background loop: near 48 with small stepwise changes (±2..±4).
   * Foreground stabs: near 92; brief terraces or tiny arcs allowed; keep them clearly louder than the loop.

5. METER SEEDS

   * For every feature’s run plan in these bars, set seeds `numerator=4`, `denominator=4`.
   * For `numerator`/`denominator` dimensions, transformations are constant `add 0`.

STRUCTURE OF THE RETURN
Return one JSON object with `"bars":[ … ]` containing three bars (16, 17, 18), each realized as a full six-instrument bundle for 4/4. All constraints from the global system prompt also apply (allowed ops; strictly increasing time; durations capped to gaps; pitch in hard ranges; monophony, etc.).

VALIDATION

* Per bar & per instrument: monophony (no overlaps) and no chords.
* Time: `add` only in {1,2,3,4}, strictly increasing; last note ends ≤ tick 16.
* Duration values in {1,2,3,4} and MAX(duration) ≤ s_min.
* Velocity ranges respected (loop ≈48; stabs ≈92).
* Adjacent-instrument unisons avoided on shared onsets; sparse octaves OK.
