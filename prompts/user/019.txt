METER: 3/4

TITLE
Bar 38 — Variation of Bar 4 (pp/ppp center-weighted chord; tiny registral/pitch-class shift).

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
[alto_flute, violin, bass_clarinet, trumpet, cello, double_bass]. Everyone plays; monophony only.

AGGREGATE — NEW for Bars 38–40
Define a modified aggregate for Bars 38–40 (not used elsewhere). Include:
"aggregate_signature" with id "bars38_40_v1" and full bands (bounds + pcs_ordered).
Keep band coverage continuous; 3–4 pcs per band; disjoint; union = 12 pcs.
It should be clearly related to Bars-4–6 but not identical (subtle pcs changes and/or band bounds).

Context rule: For Bars 38–40, include one aggregate_signature at top level with id: "bars38_40_v1". Later bars that reuse it must copy it verbatim from the reference PT JSON context.

PT REALIZATION — one sustained note per instrument
• TIME: one onset at tick 0 (N=1).
• DURATION: 12 (ends exactly at 12).
• PITCH: choose a legal MIDI near the Bar-4 role/region but reflecting the new aggregate’s band pcs; constant.
• VELOCITY: pp–ppp ≈ 40–48, constant.
• METER: seeds numerator=3, denominator=4; transforms add 0.

VALIDATION
Exactly one note per instrument; ends at tick 12; legal ranges; band-legal pcs; no overlaps.
(Include new "aggregate_signature" id = "bars38_40_v1".)
