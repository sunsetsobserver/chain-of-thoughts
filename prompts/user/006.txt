METER: 2/4

TITLE
Bars 6a–6b — One whole-bar chord per bar (A then B), no re-articulation.

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
[alto_flute, violin, bass_clarinet, trumpet, cello, double_bass]. Everyone plays in BOTH bars; monophony per instrument.

AGGREGATE REUSE
Reuse the SAME Bars-4–6 aggregate from Bars 4–5. Reuse the exact aggregate_signature from Bar 4 (identical id, bounds, pcs).

BAR-LEVEL MATERIAL (INTERNAL, DO NOT PRINT)
Define two distinct bar-pcsets, **A** (for 6a) and **B** (for 6b). Both subsets of the aggregate’s band pcs; A ≠ B; each size 4–10.  
Register targets:
- double_bass: LOW, cello: LOW↔MID, bass_clarinet: LOW↔MID,
- violin: MID, alto_flute: MID↔HIGH, trumpet: MID↔HIGH.
Avoid adjacent-instrument unisons; octave doublings OK but sparse.

PT REALIZATION — **one sustained whole-bar note per instrument, per bar**
Hard constraints per instrument **in each bar**:
• TIME: **one onset at tick 0** with **N=1**. No other onsets in that bar.  
• DURATION: **8** — the note lasts the full 2/4 bar (ticks 0..8). Ends exactly at 8.  
• PITCH: choose one legal MIDI inside the targeted band that belongs to that bar’s pcset; **keep it constant** within the bar.  
  Change pitch **between bars 6a and 6b** to reflect pcset A vs B.  
• VELOCITY: Bar 6a fixed forte (≈108–116). Bar 6b fixed mf (≈88–96). Constant within each bar.  
• METER: numerator=2, denominator=4 via seeds; meter transforms are `add 0`.

ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS
• No quarter re-articulation within a bar.  
• No onsets other than the single onset at 0.  
• No intra-bar pitch changes.

STRUCTURE OF THE RETURN
Return one JSON object with `"bars":[ … ]` containing **two bars** (6a, 6b), each a full six-instrument bundle as above.

VALIDATION
• Per bar & per instrument: exactly **one note** with onset `[0]` and duration `[8]`.  
• Ranges respected; pcs legal per band; octave doublings sparse; avoid adjacent-instrument unisons.
