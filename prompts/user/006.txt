METER: 2/4

TITLE
Bars 6a–6b — Two 2/4 tutti hits from the Bars-4–6 aggregate (A then B), contrast in pcset and dynamics.

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
[alto_flute, violin, bass_clarinet, trumpet, cello, double_bass]. Everyone plays in BOTH bars; monophony per instrument.

AGGREGATE REUSE
Reuse the SAME Bars-4–6 aggregate from Bars 4–5 (do not print it).

BAR-LEVEL MATERIAL (INTERNAL, DO NOT PRINT)
Define two distinct bar-pcsets, A (for 6a) and B (for 6b). Both are subsets of the aggregate’s band pcs; A ≠ B; each size 4–10.
Register targets:
- double_bass: LOW, cello: LOW↔MID, bass_clarinet: LOW↔MID,
- violin: MID, alto_flute: MID↔HIGH, trumpet: MID↔HIGH.
Avoid unisons between neighboring instruments; octave doublings okay but sparse.

PT REALIZATION (APPLIES TO BOTH 2/4 BARS)
Each bar is **exactly two quarter-notes tutti** at ticks 0 and 4, duration 4 each.
Per instrument and per bar:
• TIME: seed so first onset is 0; `add{4}`, N=2 ⇒ [0,4].
• DURATION: [4,4].
• PITCH: choose legal MIDIs for A (Bar 6a) and B (Bar 6b) per the instrument’s targeted band; in each bar keep the two quarters on the SAME pitch (pitch delta 0 inside a bar), but **change pitch between 6a and 6b** for contrast (different pc across the two bars).
• VELOCITY: Bar 6a = forte (≈ 108–116), Bar 6b = mf (≈ 88–96).
• METER: numerator=2, denominator=4 via seeds; meter transforms are `add 0`.

STRUCTURE OF THE RETURN
Return one JSON object with **"bars":[ … ]** containing **two bars**, each realized as the full six-instrument bundle for 2/4. All constraints in the system prompt apply.
