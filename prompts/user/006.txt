METER: 2/4

TITLE
Bars 6a–6b — Two 2/4 tutti hits from the Bars-4–6 aggregate (A then B), contrast in pcset and dynamics.

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
[alto_flute, violin, bass_clarinet, trumpet, cello, double_bass]. Everyone plays in BOTH bars; monophony per instrument.

AGGREGATE REUSE
Reuse the SAME Bars-4–6 aggregate from Bars 4–5 (do not print it).
Reuse the exact aggregate_signature from Bar 4 (identical id, bounds, pcs). Do not redefine or modify it.

BAR-LEVEL MATERIAL (INTERNAL, DO NOT PRINT)
Define two distinct bar-pcsets, A (for 6a) and B (for 6b). Both are subsets of the aggregate’s band pcs; A ≠ B; each size 4–10.
Register targets:

double_bass: LOW, cello: LOW↔MID, bass_clarinet: LOW↔MID,

violin: MID, alto_flute: MID↔HIGH, trumpet: MID↔HIGH.
Avoid unisons between neighboring instruments; octave doublings okay but sparse.

PT REALIZATION (APPLIES TO BOTH 2/4 BARS) — two quarter-note hits per bar
Each bar is exactly two notes at ticks 0 and 4, each lasting 4 ticks.
Per instrument and per bar:
• TIME: seed so first onset is 0; use a time step that yields onsets [0, 4] (N=2).
• DURATION: [4, 4] so each note fills its quarter completely.
• PITCH: choose legal MIDIs for A (Bar 6a) and B (Bar 6b) per the instrument’s targeted band; within each bar keep the two quarters on the same pitch (no intra-bar pitch change), but change pitch between 6a and 6b for contrast (different pc across the two bars).
• VELOCITY: Bar 6a = forte (≈ 108–116), Bar 6b = mf (≈ 88–96).
• METER: numerator=2, denominator=4 via seeds; meter transforms are add 0.

STRUCTURE OF THE RETURN
Return one JSON object with "bars":[ … ] containing two bars, each realized as the full six-instrument bundle for 2/4. All constraints in the system prompt apply.
