METER: 3/4

TITLE
Bar 35 — LITERAL reprise of Bar 4 (pp/ppp, center-weighted voicing), no re-composition.

AGGREGATE REUSE (REQUIRED)
Reuse the exact Bars-4–6 aggregate and its signature:
- aggregate_signature.id must be "bars4_6_v1"
- Do not redefine or modify bands or pcs. Use the original signature from Bar 4.

REALIZATION — IDENTICAL FORM (one sustained note per instrument)
Everyone plays one bar-long sustain; monophonic per instrument.

Hard constraints (copy from Bar 4):
• TIME: exactly one onset at tick 0; N=1. No other onsets.
• DURATION: 12 (spans 0..12, ends exactly at 12).
• PITCH: identical MIDI values to Bar 4 if available in context. If exact values are unknown, choose the nearest legal MIDI for the same instrument, band, and bar-pcset used in Bar 4, preserving center-weighted voicing and avoiding adjacent-instrument unisons (octaves sparse).
• VELOCITY: very soft, identical to Bar 4 if available; otherwise constant pp–ppp ≈ 40–48 (tiny deltas ≤2).
• METER: numerator=3, denominator=4 via seeds; transforms for meter are add 0.

VALIDATION
• Exactly one note per instrument (onset [0], duration [12]).
• All MIDI inside hard ranges; pcs legal for the original band at that register.
• No re-articulation; no extra events.
