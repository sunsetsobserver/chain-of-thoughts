METER: 3/4

TITLE
Part 2 — Trumpet Entrance (Bars 23–33): strings and winds continue exactly what they played before-calm, homophonic group writing; trumpet enters above with a vivid, faster, jazz-inflected solo (question/answer). 
Post-tonal color that blends post-tonal/jazz harmony into a 12-tone aware palette; thirdal/quartal tendencies with tasteful extensions (2/9, 4/11, 6/13, 7 where musical). The three layers remain transparent and balanced.

FORCES
Three layers:
• Strings (grouped homophony): violin, cello, double_bass — repeat once again the idea from Bars 1-11, which they also already repeated once before in Bars 12-22.
• Winds (grouped homophony): alto_flute, bass_clarinet — repeat exactly the material that they played in Bars 12-22.
• Trumpet (solo): independent monophonic melody (faster rhythm), clearly foregrounded but never masking harmony.

RHYTHM→PT MAPPING (3/4, BAR_TICKS = 12)
• Quarter = 4 ticks, Half = 8, Dotted half = 12 (used as duration values).
• Write exactly the number of musical events in the bar (N = 1 or 2). Use single sustained notes (no chained quarters).
Patterns:
1) Dotted half — N=1, onset 0, duration 12.
2) Half + Quarter — N=2, onsets 0 and 8, durations 8 and 4 (time adds: [8]).
3) Quarter + Half — N=2, onsets 0 and 4, durations 4 and 8 (time adds: [4]).
4) Half + Quarter rest — N=1, onset 0, duration 8 (you may include a harmless extra `add` in time; with N=1 no extra onset is realized).
5) Quarter rest + Half — N=1, onset 4, duration 8 (set seeds.time = 4; you may include a harmless extra `add`).
Rests are realized by omitting events (no silent notes). Do not simulate sustains by repeating the same pitch on 4-tick segments.

LITERAL REPEAT (groups)
• Strings (Bars 23–33): copy Bars 1–11 exactly (Bar 23 ← Bar 1, …, Bar 33 ← Bar 11). New `pt.name` only.
• Winds (Bars 23–33): copy Bars 12–22 exactly (Bar 23 ← Bar 12, …, Bar 33 ← Bar 22). New `pt.name` only.

TEXTURE
• Within each group (strings; winds): identical rhythm per bar (same onsets & durations); rests apply to the whole group segment.
• Between groups: strings vs winds may choose different patterns each bar to maintain a gentle dialogue.
• Trumpet: fully independent rhythm/melody, weaving above, sometimes dovetailing with group changes but not bound to their grid, should be in close dialogue with the harmony of the rest, as if they play the trumpet's accompaniament.

Trumpet (solo): quick, lyrical, question/answer over two-bar spans.
– Primary motion in eighths and sixteenths, but also occasional quarter notes possible and occasional break for phrasing: time steps add {1,2,3} predominantly; occasional {3,4,5} to shape phrases.
– Durations mostly 1–4 ticks, with occasional 4-8 ticks for cadential lean-tos or held color tones.
– N per bar typically 5–12 (stay readable, no walls of notes).
– Leave tiny breath space in ~every other bar by omitting one short slot near the end.
– Clear phrase commas at the barline or beat 3→next bar.

HARMONY & VOICING of Trumpet (solo)
• Range: MIDI 55–92 (prefer mid–high). Shape a singing line that outlines/extends the vertical harmony (9/11/13, altered color tones, chromatic approaches). Favor stepwise motion with occasional expressive leaps (4th/5th/6th, occasional 7th then resolve).
• Avoid sitting on the bass root; prefer extensions/upper structures. Resolve dissonances tastefully to inside notes at phrase ends.
• Dynamic presence: mf→f, with local peaks; never cover the harmony.

The test of the instruments repeat exactly what they played before.

DYNAMICS
Trumpet in the foreground (mf→f) with musical contour. Balance overlaps so the harmony reads. The rest of instruments repeat how they played before.

OUTPUT SCOPE
Generate exactly 11 bars labeled conceptually as Bars 23–33 (meter 3/4). Strings and winds proceed exactly as in earlier bars (grouped homophony, independent between groups). Trumpet adds the solo line above as specified.

FINAL OUTPUT (schema essentials)
Return one JSON object with top-level `"bars":[ … ]` containing 11 bars.
Each bar has exactly six features with `meta.instrument` in:
`["alto_flute","violin","bass_clarinet","trumpet","cello","double_bass"]`.
Each feature’s `pt.dimensions` list has exactly six entries in this order (keys & order matter):

```
"dimensions":[
  {"feature_name":"time","transformations":[...]},
  {"feature_name":"duration","transformations":[...]},
  {"feature_name":"pitch","transformations":[...]},
  {"feature_name":"velocity","transformations":[...]},
  {"feature_name":"numerator","transformations":[{"name":"add","args":[0]}]},
  {"feature_name":"denominator","transformations":[{"name":"add","args":[0]}]}
]
```

Include a `run_plan` with six entries (one per feature); `"feature_name"` string-matches the corresponding `pt.name`; meter seeds = 3/4.

SELF-CHECK BEFORE RETURNING
• 11 bars present.
• Group homophony holds inside strings and inside winds per bar; Their groups repeat exactly the material played in the previous 11 bars (Bars 12-22)
• Trumpet uses faster values then the rest of the groups as specified; last note ends ≤ 12 ticks.
• All pitches within stated ranges; vertical harmony remains clear; trumpet extends/enlivens without masking.
