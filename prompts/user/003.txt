METER: 3/4
Ticks per bar: 12 (quarter=4, half=8, dotted half=12)

TITLE
Part 3 — Bars 31–45 (15 bars): strings AND winds repeat exactly their 15-bar materials from earlier units; trumpet enters with a gentle, lyrical line. Post-tonal color with jazz extensions (2/9, 4/11, 6/13, 7), quartal/quintal inflections, smooth spacing.

FORCES (6 features per bar, exact order)
["alto_flute","violin","bass_clarinet","trumpet","cello","double_bass"]

AUTHORITATIVE REFERENCES (DO NOT ALTER ANY NUMBERS)
• Strings must copy from Prompt 1 (Bars 1–15) exactly.
• Winds must copy from Prompt 2 (its 15 bars) exactly.

LITERAL REPEAT MAPPINGS (exact copy of numbers)
Let current bars be Bars 31–45 (15 bars).
• Strings mapping (violin, cello, double_bass):
  - Bar 31 ← Strings Bar 1 from REFERENCE_STRINGS
  - Bar 32 ← Strings Bar 2
  - …
  - Bar 45 ← Strings Bar 15
• Winds mapping (alto_flute, bass_clarinet):
  - Bar 31 ← Winds Bar 1 from REFERENCE_WINDS
  - Bar 32 ← Winds Bar 2
  - …
  - Bar 45 ← Winds Bar 15

COPY RULES (bit-for-bit identity except names)
For each mapped bar and each relevant instrument:
• Copy the entire pt.dimensions array (same keys, same transform names, same args, same order).
• Copy run_plan.N and run_plan.seeds exactly (time, duration, pitch, velocity, numerator, denominator).
• Assign fresh pt.name strings (unique) but do not change any other numeric content.

TRUMPET (NEW MATERIAL)
• Trumpet is now active (not tacet). Choose one allowed pattern per bar (independent of strings/winds), aligned to {0,4,8}:
  - Half note + 4 sixteents notes: N=5, onsets 0,8,9,10,11; durations 8,1,1,1,1
  - 4 sixteents notes + Half note: N=5, onsets 0,1,2,3,4; durations 1,1,1,1,8
  - Two sixteenths + one eight + one eight + two sixteents + Quarter rest: N=6, onsets 0,1,2,4,6,7 durations 1,1,2,2,1,1
  - Quarter rest + 4 sixteents + 2 eight notes: N=6, onsets 4,5,6,7,8,10 durations 1,1,1,1,2,2
• Use single sustained notes (no chained quarters). Keep dynamics soft (≈ p–mp). Prefer clear, stepwise motion with occasional jumps and leaps for longer notes.

GROUPED HOMOPHONY
• Strings group: homophony is inherited by exact repeat from REFERENCE_STRINGS.
• Winds group: homophony is inherited by exact repeat from REFERENCE_WINDS.
• Trumpet: independent line (solo group of one). Stays within the harmonic field created by the strings and winds. 

HARMONY & VOICING
• Maintain clear vertical sonorities with strings+bass; avoid blatant parallel perfect fifths with double_bass across successive changes.
• Tasteful extensions (2/9, 4/11, 6/13, 7) and quartal/quintal color allowed within the hard range.

HARD RANGES (MIDI)
• alto_flute: 53..81
• violin: 55..88
• bass_clarinet: 43..74
• trumpet: 60..82
• cello: 48..74
• double_bass: 31..55

SCHEMA REQUIREMENTS (strict)
• Return ONE JSON object with top-level "bars":[ … ] containing EXACTLY 15 bars (Bars 31–45).
• Each bar has exactly six features with meta.instrument in this exact order:
  ["alto_flute","violin","bass_clarinet","trumpet","cello","double_bass"].
• Each feature’s pt.dimensions list has exactly six entries in THIS order:
  time, duration, pitch, velocity, numerator(add 0), denominator(add 0).
• Include a run_plan with six entries (one per feature); run_plan[i].feature_name MUST equal that feature’s pt.name.
• All meter seeds set numerator=3, denominator=4.
• Last onset + duration ≤ 12 in every feature.

PRECEDENCE LADDER
1) Exact numeric copy for strings from REFERENCE_STRINGS (bar mapping)
2) Exact numeric copy for winds from REFERENCE_WINDS (bar mapping)
3) Schema & instrument order
4) Hard ranges
5) Allowed rhythms
6) Harmony/style guidance

MANDATORY SELF-CHECK BEFORE RETURNING
• Count bars == 15. If not, regenerate.
• For every string and wind feature in Bars 31–45, confirm that pt.dimensions and run_plan (N + seeds) match the mapped reference bar bit-for-bit (except pt.name). If any mismatch, regenerate.
• Trumpet patterns conform to allowed rhythms; N ∈ {1,2}; seeds.time ∈ {0,4,8} (or ≈4 for the “Quarter rest + Half” case).
• All pitches within hard ranges; last onset+duration ≤ 12.

OUTPUT
Return exactly ONE JSON object (no prose).
