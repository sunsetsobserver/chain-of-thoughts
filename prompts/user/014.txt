METER: 4/4

TITLE
Bar 36 — LITERAL reprise of Bar 5 (single whole-bar chord, soft), no re-composition.

REALIZATION — IDENTICAL FORM (one sustained note per instrument)
Everyone plays one whole-bar sustain; monophonic per instrument.

Hard constraints (copy from Bar 5):
• TIME: exactly one onset at tick 0; N=1. No other onsets.
• DURATION: 16 (spans 0..16, ends exactly at 16).
• PITCH: identical MIDI values to Bar 5 if available; otherwise select the nearest legal MIDI for the same instrument, band, and Bar-5 bar-pcset, preserving center-weighted voicing and avoiding adjacent-instrument unisons (octaves sparse).
• VELOCITY: identical to Bar 5 if available; otherwise constant soft ≈ 44–52.
• METER: seeds set numerator=4, denominator=4; meter transforms add 0.

Literal reuse from context: Copy the earlier bar’s PT design exactly from the reference PT JSON (same N, seeds, and transformations), changing only feature names.

VALIDATION
• Per instrument: time [0], duration [16] only; no extra events.
