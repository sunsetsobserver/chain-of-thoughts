AGGREGATE REUSE

PT REALIZATION — exactly one sustained whole-bar note per instrument
• TIME: one onset at tick 0 (N=1).
• DURATION: 16 (full bar; ends exactly at 16).
• PITCH: same (or nearest legal) choices as Bar 5 per role; constant.
• VELOCITY: pp–p ≈ 44–52, constant (small ±2..4 OK).
• METER: numerator=4, denominator=4 via seeds; meter transforms add 0.

VALIDATION
Per instrument: onset [0], duration [16]; legal ranges; band-legal pcs; no overlaps.
(Include "aggregate_signature" unchanged.)
