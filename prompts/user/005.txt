METER: 4/4

TITLE
Bar 5 — one whole-bar chord (no re-articulation). Continuation of the harmonic material started in the previous bar 4.

INSTRUMENTS
Everyone plays: [alto_flute, violin, bass_clarinet, trumpet, cello, double_bass]. 
Single instrument can only play one note at the time (no polyphony within one instrument allowed).

BAR-PCSET & VOICING (INTERNAL GUIDE)
Choose a bar-pcset (size 5–10) that contrasts with Bar 4; center-weighted voicing:
- double_bass: LOW anchor (avoid unison with cello)
- cello + bass_clarinet: LOW↔MID
- violin + alto_flute + trumpet: MID (avoid exact unisons)
Important: consider correct voicing rules between this and previous chord.

PT REALIZATION — exactly one sustained whole-bar note per instrument
Hard constraints per instrument:
• TIME: one onset at tick 0 with N=1. No other onsets in this bar.  
• DURATION: 16 ticks — the note lasts the full 4/4 bar (ticks 0..16). Starts exactly at the beginning of the bar and ends exactly at the end (fills in the whole bar of 4/4; takes 16 ticks).  
• PITCH: choose one legal MIDI inside the instrument’s band and inside the bar-pcset; keep it constant for the entire bar (no intra-bar pitch change).  
• VELOCITY: choose a fixed soft dynamic (e.g., pp–p ≈ 44–52). Velocity is constant within the bar.  
• METER: numerator=4, denominator=4 via seeds; meter transforms are `add 0`.

ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS
• No re-articulation. For each instrument N=1, and that's it.
• No onsets other than the single onset at 0.  
• No intra-bar pitch changes.

VALIDATION
• Per instrument: exactly one note with onset `[0]` and duration `[16]`.  
• Ranges respected; pcs legal per band; avoid adjacent-instrument unisons; octave doublings sparse, consider good voicing with the previous bar's material.
