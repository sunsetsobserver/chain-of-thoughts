METER: 4/4

TITLE
Bar 5 — Bars-4–6 aggregate continued; new bar-pcset; two half-bar pillars (pp→p).

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
[alto_flute, violin, bass_clarinet, trumpet, cello, double_bass]. Everyone plays; monophony only.

AGGREGATE REUSE
Reuse the SAME Bars-4–6 aggregate you internally created in Bar 4 (do not print it).
Reuse the exact aggregate_signature you output in Bar 4. Copy the same object (same id, same band bounds, same pcs). Do not alter it.

BAR-SPECIFIC PCSET + VOICING (INTERNAL GUIDE)
Pick a DIFFERENT bar-pcset than Bar 4 (size 5–10), voicing hint = “cluster-leaning in mids”:

double_bass: LOW anchor (avoid unison with cello),

cello + bass_clarinet: LOW↔MID,

violin + alto_flute + trumpet: MID (tight cluster tendency, but no exact unisons).

PT REALIZATION — exactly two sustained half-bar notes per instrument
Per instrument:
• TIME: exactly two onsets at ticks 0 and 8 (N=2).
– Override note: for this bar only, you may use a single time step of add 8 to place the second onset at tick 8 (we want [0, 8], not quarter-grid stepping).
• DURATION: each note lasts 8 ticks (half of the 16-tick bar). The first note spans 0..8; the second spans 8..16.
• PITCH: choose one pitch for the bar (constant across both halves) that belongs to the bar-pcset and is legal for the instrument’s band at that register. Net pitch change across the bar must be zero.
• VELOCITY: gentle swell pp→p across the two halves (e.g., ~44 → ~50; per-step delta ≤ 6; stay subtle).
• METER: numerator=4, denominator=4 via seeds; meter transforms are add 0.

VALIDATION
• Exactly two notes per instrument with onsets [0, 8] and durations [8, 8].
• Ranges respected; pcs legal per band; avoid adjacent-instrument unisons inside each pillar; occasional octave doublings okay but limited.
• Last sustain ends at tick 16.
