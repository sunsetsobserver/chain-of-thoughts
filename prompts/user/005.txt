METER: 4/4

TITLE
Bar 5 — Bars-4–6 aggregate continued; one whole-bar chord (no re-articulation).

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
[alto_flute, violin, bass_clarinet, trumpet, cello, double_bass]. Everyone plays; monophony only.

AGGREGATE REUSE
Reuse the SAME Bars-4–6 aggregate from Bar 4. Reuse the exact aggregate_signature (same id, bounds, pcs).

BAR-PCSET & VOICING (INTERNAL GUIDE)
Choose a bar-pcset (size 5–10) that contrasts with Bar 4; center-weighted voicing:
- double_bass: LOW anchor (avoid unison with cello)
- cello + bass_clarinet: LOW↔MID
- violin + alto_flute + trumpet: MID (avoid exact unisons)

PT REALIZATION — exactly one sustained whole-bar note per instrument
Hard constraints per instrument:
• TIME: one onset at tick 0 with N=1. No other onsets in this bar.  
• DURATION: 16 — the note lasts the full 4/4 bar (ticks 0..16). Ends exactly at 16.  
• PITCH: choose one legal MIDI inside the instrument’s band and inside the bar-pcset; keep it constant for the entire bar (no intra-bar pitch change).  
• VELOCITY: choose a fixed soft dynamic (e.g., pp–p ≈ 44–52). Velocity is constant within the bar.  
• METER: numerator=4, denominator=4 via seeds; meter transforms are `add 0`.

ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS
• No quarter or sub-quarter re-articulation.  
• No onsets other than the single onset at 0.  
• No intra-bar pitch changes.

VALIDATION
• Per instrument: exactly one note with onset `[0]` and duration `[16]`.  
• Ranges respected; pcs legal per band; avoid adjacent-instrument unisons; octave doublings sparse.
