METER: 4/4

TITLE
Bar 39 — Variation of Bar 5 (soft whole-bar chord; keep center-weighted voicing).

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
[alto_flute, violin, bass_clarinet, trumpet, cello, double_bass]. Everyone plays; monophony only.

AGGREGATE REUSE
Reuse the SAME Bars 38–40 aggregate from Bar 38. Include the identical
"aggregate_signature" (id "bars38_40_v1"; unchanged).

PT REALIZATION
• TIME: onset [0] (N=1).
• DURATION: [16].
• PITCH: legal per band under the new aggregate; close to Bar 5 roles but not identical.
• VELOCITY: pp–p ≈ 44–52, constant.
• METER: numerator=4, denominator=4 via seeds; transforms add 0.

VALIDATION
One note per instrument; ends at 16; legal ranges; band pcs legal; no overlaps.
(Include "aggregate_signature" unchanged.)
