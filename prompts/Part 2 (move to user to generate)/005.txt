METER: 3/4
Ticks per bar: 12 (quarter=4, half=8, dotted half=12)

TITLE
Part 2 — Coda (Bars 49–60, 12 bars): all six instruments present entirely new material, but within the same harmonic language as before. Everyone plays strict homophony (identical rhythm across all six instruments) from start to finish. Character: majestic, proud, and ultimately calm and open; the last sonority should feel like a question that Part 3 will answer.

FORCES (six features per bar, fixed order)
["alto_flute","bass_clarinet","trumpet","violin","cello","double_bass"]

GLOBAL TEXTURE — GROUPED HOMOPHONY (ALL SIX)
• In every bar, all six instruments share exactly the same onsets and durations (single shared rhythm).
• Pitches/velocities differ by part (range-aware voicings), but the time grid is identical across all six.

RHYTHMS (choose freely per bar; align to {0,4,8}; sustained notes only; no chained quarters)
Use the same 3/4 patterns as earlier. Write exactly the number of musical events in the bar (N ∈ {1,2}).

1. Dotted half — N=1, onset 0, duration 12.
2. Half + Quarter — N=2, onsets 0 & 8; durations 8 & 4 (time adds: [8]).
3. Quarter + Half — N=2, onsets 0 & 4; durations 4 & 8 (time adds: [4]).
4. Half + Quarter rest — N=1, onset 0, duration 8.
5. Quarter rest + Half — N=1, onset 4, duration 8 (set seeds.time=4).

RHYTHM → PT MAPPING (strict)
• Use single sustained notes per event (no tying quarters to fake longer values).
• For N=2 patterns, set the time dimension to a single add step sized to the second onset:
– Half + Quarter → `time.transformations = [ {add: 8} ]`
– Quarter + Half → `time.transformations = [ {add: 4} ]`
• For N=1 patterns, keep `time.transforms = [ {add: 0} ]` (or harmless extra adds that do not produce a new onset); never emit `time.add 12` with N=1.

HARMONY & VOICING (new material, same language)
• Maintain the mixed post-tonal / jazz palette with tasteful extensions (2/9, 4/11, 6/13, 7), quartal/quintal colors, and smooth spacing.
• Double bass provides foundational tones (not always the “root” — open, modern voicings encouraged).
• Avoid blatant parallel perfect fifths with the double_bass across successive changes.
• Final bar (Bar 60): choose a sustained pattern (often the Dotted half, N=1) and voice an open, questioning sonority (e.g., omit the triadic 3rd; allow perfect 5ths + added 2/9 or 11; gentle dynamics).

DYNAMICS & SHAPE
• Broad, dignified arc (mp → mf), then dim. to p by the last bar.
• Trumpet remains noble (no brash sfz); winds blend; strings support with warm, centered tone.

HARD RANGES (MIDI — must stay inside)
• alto_flute: 53..81
• bass_clarinet: 43..74
• trumpet: 60..82
• violin: 55..88
• cello: 48..74
• double_bass: 31..55

SCHEMA REQUIREMENTS (strict)
• Return ONE JSON object with top-level `"bars":[ … ]` containing EXACTLY 12 bars (Bars 49–60).
• Each bar has exactly six features with `meta.instrument` in this exact order:
`["alto_flute","bass_clarinet","trumpet","violin","cello","double_bass"]`.
• Set `meta.role` for every feature to `"homophony"`.
• Each feature’s `pt.dimensions` list has exactly six entries in this order:

1. time, 2) duration, 3) pitch, 4) velocity, 5) numerator (add 0), 6) denominator (add 0).
   • Include a `run_plan` with six entries (one per feature); `run_plan[i].feature_name` must equal that feature’s `pt.name`.
   • For all features, seeds must set `numerator=3`, `denominator=4`.
   • Onsets must be < 12; last onset + duration ≤ 12 in every feature.

PRECEDENCE LADDER

1. Schema & instrument order
2. Grouped homophony across all six instruments (identical onsets/durations per bar)
3. Hard ranges
4. Allowed rhythms & PT mapping rules
5. Harmony/style and dynamic guidance

MANDATORY SELF-CHECK BEFORE RETURNING
• Count bars == 12 (Bars 49–60).
• In each bar, confirm that all six instruments have identical time/duration arrays and that the pattern is one of the allowed set; N ∈ {1,2}.
• Confirm `numerator/denominator` transforms are `add 0`; seeds set to 3/4.
• Confirm no `time.add 12` with N=1; all onsets < 12; last onset + duration ≤ 12.
• Confirm all pitches lie within hard ranges.
• Optional musical sanity check: final bar has an open, questioning sonority and a soft ending.

OUTPUT
Return exactly ONE JSON object (no prose).
