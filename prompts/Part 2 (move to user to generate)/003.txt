METER: 3/4
Ticks per bar: 12 (quarter=4, half=8, dotted half=12)

TITLE
Part 3 — Bars 25–36 (12 bars): winds and trumpet repeat exactly their 12-bar materials from earlier units; The strings change their material. They compose new post-tonal color with jazz extensions (2/9, 4/11, 6/13, 7), quartal/quintal inflections, smooth spacing that fit the strings, but this time differently than in the previous fragment.

FORCES (6 features per bar, exact order)
["alto_flute", "bass_clarinet", "trumpet", "violin", "cello", "double_bass"]

AUTHORITATIVE REFERENCES (DO NOT ALTER ANY NUMBERS)
• Winds and trumpet must copy their material from Prompt 2 (Bars 12–24) exactly.

LITERAL REPEAT MAPPINGS (exact copy of numbers)
Let current bars be Bars 25–36 (12 bars).
• Winds and trumpet mapping (alto_flute, bass_clarinet, trumpet):
  - Bar 25 ← Winds Bar 13 from REFERENCE_WINDS_AND_TRUMPET_JSON
  - Bar 26 ← Winds Bar 14
  - …
  - Bar 36 ← Winds Bar 24

COPY RULES (bit-for-bit identity except names)
For each mapped bar and each relevant instrument:
• Copy the entire pt.dimensions array (same keys, same transform names, same args, same order).
• Copy run_plan.N and run_plan.seeds exactly (time, duration, pitch, velocity, numerator, denominator).
• Assign fresh pt.name winds and trumpet (unique) but do not change any other numeric content.

And for these repeats (winds and trumpet): **do not emit `time.add 12` with N=1**. Either:

* Copy the exact prior `time` transforms from the reference, or
* Keep `seed.time=0` and make `time.transforms=[add 0]` when `N=1`.

STRINGS (NEW MATERIAL):

RHYTHM & GROUPED HOMOPHONY
• Within the group, all instruments share the same onsets/durations in that bar.
• Between groups: rhythms may differ. So all strings play the same homophonic rhythm, which can be different than the one played by the group of winds and trumpet.

ALLOWED  RHYTHMS FOR STRINGS (per bar; align to ticks {0,4,8}; single sustained notes only—no chained quarters)
• Quarter = 4 ticks, Half = 8, Dotted half = 12 (used as duration values).
• Write exactly the number of musical events in the bar (N = 1 or 2). Use single sustained notes (no chained quarters).
Patterns:
1) Dotted half — N=1, onset 0, duration 12.
2) Half + Quarter — N=2, onsets 0 and 8, durations 8 and 4 (time adds: [8]).
3) Quarter + Half — N=2, onsets 0 and 4, durations 4 and 8 (time adds: [4]).
4) Half + Quarter rest — N=1, onset 0, duration 8 (you may include a harmless extra `add` in time; with N=1 no extra onset is realized).
5) Quarter rest + Half — N=1, onset 4, duration 8 (set seeds.time = 4; you may include a harmless extra `add`).
Rests are realized by omitting events (no silent notes). Do not simulate sustains by repeating the same pitch on 4-tick segments.

HARMONY FOR STRINGS:
They compose new post-tonal color with jazz extensions (2/9, 4/11, 6/13, 7), quartal/quintal inflections, smooth spacing that fit the material of winds and trumpet, but this time differently than in the previous fragment (the referenced exactly copied fragment).

HARD RANGES (MIDI)
• alto_flute: 53..81
• bass_clarinet: 43..74
• trumpet: 60..82
• violin: 55..88
• cello: 48..74
• double_bass: 31..55

SCHEMA REQUIREMENTS (strict)
• Return ONE JSON object with top-level "bars":[ … ] containing EXACTLY 12 bars (Bars 25–36).
• Each bar has exactly six features with meta.instrument in this exact order:
  ["alto_flute", "bass_clarinet", "trumpet", "violin", "cello", "double_bass"].
• Each feature’s pt.dimensions list has exactly six entries in THIS order:
  time, duration, pitch, velocity, numerator(add 0), denominator(add 0).
• Include a run_plan with six entries (one per feature); run_plan[i].feature_name MUST equal that feature’s pt.name.
• All meter seeds set numerator=3, denominator=4.
• Last onset + duration ≤ 12 in every feature.

PRECEDENCE LADDER
1) Exact numeric copy for winds from REFERENCE_WINDS (bar mapping)
2) New material for strings following the rhythmic and harmonic conditions outlined above.
3) Schema & instrument order
4) Hard ranges
5) Allowed rhythms
6) Harmony/style guidance

MANDATORY SELF-CHECK BEFORE RETURNING
• Count bars == 12.
• Onsets must be < 12. Set time: add 0, N=1 for sustained events, never add 12 with N=1 — that encodes an onset at the bar boundary and will be rejected.
• For every alto flute, bass clarinet, and trumpet feature in Bars 25–36, confirm that pt.dimensions and run_plan (N + seeds) match the mapped reference bar bit-for-bit (except pt.name).
• All pitches within hard ranges; last onset+duration ≤ 12.

OUTPUT
Return exactly ONE JSON object (no prose).
