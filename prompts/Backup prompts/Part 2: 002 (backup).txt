METER: 3/4

TITLE
Part 2 — Continuation (Bars 12–22): strings continue the calm, homophonic progression; winds enter as a second homophonic group with their own phrasing. Post-tonal color blending tonal and jazz harmony into a 12-tone aware palette, with thirdal/quartal tendencies and tasteful extensions (2/9, 4/11, 5, 6/13, 7 where musical). The two groups form a soft dialogue, enriching the vertical harmony.

FORCES
Two independent homophonic groups:
• Strings: violin, cello, double_bass (continue the idea from Bars 1–11).
• Winds: alto_flute, bass_clarinet,  (new group; same rhythmic vocabulary as strings but their own rhythm per bar).
• Trumpet tacet=silent.

TEXTURE (GROUPED HOMOPHONY)
• Within each group, the instruments always share the same rhythm in a bar (identical onsets and durations for that bar); if there’s a rest segment, all three (violin, cello, contrabass) or two (alto flute, bass clarinet) in that group rest for that segment.
• Between groups, rhythms may differ (independent choices each bar) to create a gentle call-and-response. Keep the overall surface calm; avoid clutter.

RHYTHMS (per group, choose freely per bar; variety; no two identical bars in a row unless musically justified)
Align events to the quarter grid (bar ticks 0, 4, 8). Allowed patterns:

1. Dotted half (fills the bar).
2. Half + Quarter.
3. Quarter + Half.
4. Half + Quarter rest.
5. Quarter rest + Half.

REALIZATION OF THESE RHYTHMS (simple and strict)
• Quarter = 4 ticks, Half = 8, Dotted half = 12 (as duration add values).
• Use single notes with the correct durations (do not chain quarters to fake a half or dotted half).
• N equals the number of notes actually played by that instrument in the bar (1 or 2).
• Rests: simply omit those events (no silent notes needed inside the bar).

HARMONY & VOICING (vertical richness, smooth motion)
• Strings continue from Bars 1–11: choose Bar 12 opening close to the last string harmony; build an expressive, quickly shifting progression over Bars 12–22 with gentle growth and at least one subtle return of earlier color.
• double_bass = root of each string chord; cello + violin supply the other chord tones (post-tonal/jazz palette with thirdal/quartal flavor and tasteful extensions).
• Winds (alto flute and bass clarinet) contribute complementary upper-structure colors (added 2/9, 4/11, 6/13, 7, quartal/quintal trichords, or gentle tensions) that work vertically with the strings at every change; avoid crude doublings unless used for emphasis.
• Aim for clear voice-leading (mostly stepwise in upper parts, small leaps allowed), comfortable spacing, and avoid blatant parallel perfect fifths with the bass across successive changes.
• Let the winds’ phrase design be independent but musically conversational with the strings (e.g., answer after a string change, or hover while strings move, then step forward).
• Trumpet stays silent for the entire fragment.

RANGES (stay inside)
• double_bass: MIDI 28–55 (prefer low–mid).
• cello: MIDI 36–76 (prefer low–mid).
• violin: MIDI 55–100 (prefer mid).
• bass_clarinet: MIDI 38–82 (prefer low–mid).
• alto_flute: MIDI 60–96 (prefer mid–high).
• trumpet: MIDI 55–92 (prefer mid–high).

DYNAMICS (calm arc, balanced dialogue)
Soft sustained character (≈ p to mp). Gentle shaping only. When groups overlap, balance so harmonies read clearly (no aggressive accents).

OUTPUT SCOPE
Generate exactly 11 bars labeled conceptually as Bars 12–22 (meter 3/4). The strings should feel continuous with Bars 1–11; the winds (alto flute and bass clarinet) add independent homophonic phrases per bar.

FINAL OUTPUT (schema essentials)
Return one JSON object with top-level `"bars":[ … ]` containing 11 bars.
Each bar has exactly five features with `meta.instrument` in:
`["alto_flute","violin","bass_clarinet", "cello","double_bass"]`.
Each feature’s `pt.dimensions` list has exactly six entries in this order (keys & order matter):

```
"dimensions":[
    {"feature_name":"time","transformations":[...]},
    {"feature_name":"duration","transformations":[...]},
    {"feature_name":"pitch","transformations":[...]},
    {"feature_name":"velocity","transformations":[...]},
    {"feature_name":"numerator","transformations":[{"name":"add","args":[0]}]},
    {"feature_name":"denominator","transformations":[{"name":"add","args":[0]}]}
]
```

Include a `run_plan` with six entries (one per feature); `"feature_name"` string-matches the corresponding `pt.name`; meter seeds = 3/4.

Self-check before returning:
• 11 bars present.
• Group homophony holds: within each group (strings; winds) the instruments within one group share identical time/duration per bar.
• Between groups, rhythms may differ but remain from the allowed set; durations are single 4/8/12 values.
• Last note per feature ends ≤ 12 ticks; all pitches within the ranges above.
• Vertical harmonies read clearly; winds enrich strings without collisions that obscure the sonority.
