METER: 4/4

TITLE
Bar 37 — LITERAL reprise of Bar 6: two half-note chords (A then B), no re-composition.

REALIZATION — IDENTICAL FORM (two half-notes per instrument)
Each instrument plays a chord at tick 0 (pcset A) and tick 8 (pcset B).

Hard constraints (copy from Bar 6):
• TIME: N=2 with onsets [0, 8]. No other onsets.
• DURATION: [8, 8] (sustains 0–8 and 8–16).
• PITCH: identical to Bar 6 if available; otherwise choose nearest legal MIDIs for the same instrument, bands, and half-bar pcsets (A then B), avoiding adjacent-instrument unisons; octaves sparse.
• VELOCITY: first half forte ≈ 108–116, second half mezzo-forte ≈ 88–96, constant within each half; copy exact values if available.
• METER: seeds numerator=4, denominator=4; meter transforms add 0.

ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS
• No re-articulation inside each half; no extra onsets beyond [0, 8].
• No intra-half pitch changes.

Literal reuse from context: Copy the earlier bar’s PT design exactly from the reference PT JSON (same N, seeds, and transformations), changing only feature names.

VALIDATION
• Exactly two notes per instrument with durations [8,8], ending at 16.
