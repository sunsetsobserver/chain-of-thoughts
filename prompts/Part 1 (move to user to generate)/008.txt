METER: 3/4

TITLE
Bars 10–13 — Four bars of 3/4 featuring a background loop and foreground staccato hits (Aggregate B).

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
[alto_flute, bass_clarinet, trumpet, violin, cello, double_bass].
Monophony per instrument.

AGGREGATE (INTERNAL, DO NOT PRINT)
Internally construct a new aggregate named Aggregate B for Bars 10–13:
• Same band structure as before (LOW/MID/HIGH per instrument, 3–4 pcs each).
• Disjoint pcs across bands → union = 12 pcs (0–11).
• Different from Aggregate A in pcs content and/or band boundaries.

SECTION STRUCTURE
Produce four bars in 3/4 (each bar has ticks 0..11).
Split instruments into two groups (3 + 3):
• Background Loop Group: steady loop repeated identically in each of the four bars.
• Foreground Hit Group: new short staccato events each bar.

PT REALIZATION

Background Loop (3 instruments)
• TIME: strictly increasing onsets using add {1,2,3,4} (no 0). Aim for 4–8 notes per bar; all onsets < 12.
• DURATION: positive and ≤ distance to next onset or bar end (so no overlaps).
• PITCH: add/sub only within Aggregate B band pcs; seed ≈ tessitura center; stay inside hard range.
• VELOCITY: ≈ 48 (±4), consistent.
• The same loop (timing, durations, pitches, velocities) repeats exactly in all four bars.

Literal repetition across bars: Make the loop identical in all four bars by using the same dimensions and run_plan (seeds, N) per loop instrument so the realized arrays (time, duration, pitch, velocity) are byte-for-byte identical across Bars 10–13.

Foreground Hits (3 instruments)
• Each bar contains 3–8 short events.
• Events may involve 1–3 of the foreground instruments at once; no unisons between active neighbors in the same event (octaves OK but sparse).
• TIME: prefer off-beats; ≤ ~1/3 of events may fall on {0,4,8}.
• DURATION: 1–3 ticks (staccato); no overlaps within any single instrument.
• PITCH: legal Aggregate B band pcs and instrument ranges; add/sub only.
• VELOCITY: ≈ 92 (±6), energetic contrast with the loop.
• Each bar’s foreground material is newly composed (do not copy earlier bars).

GENERAL RULES
• All time streams strictly increase; durations never exceed the gap to the next onset or bar end.
• All pitches legal for both Aggregate B and instrument hard ranges.
• Meter fixed per bar via seeds: numerator=3, denominator=4; transforms are add 0.
• Monophony enforced for every instrument.

STRUCTURE OF THE RETURN
Return one JSON object with "bars":[ … ] containing four bars (10–13), each including all six instruments.

VALIDATION
• Exactly four bars in 3/4 (12 ticks per bar).
• Three loop instruments repeat identical material across all four bars.
• Three hit instruments generate new staccato patterns in each bar.
• No overlaps within any instrument.
• All MIDI pitches within range and legal for band pcs.
