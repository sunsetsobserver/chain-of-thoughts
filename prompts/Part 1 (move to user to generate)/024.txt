METER: 3/4

TITLE
Bars 46–49 — “Response” fragment in 3/4: ppp texture, triumphant trumpet melody on top.

CONTEXT LINK (INTERNAL, DO NOT PRINT)
This section answers the earlier 4×3/4 fragment (Bars 42–45) with new harmony and rhythm. All supporting instruments are extremely soft (ppp), while the trumpet now carries a through-composed, triumphant melody (not just sustained tones). Keep the new aggregate materially different from the one used in Bars 42–45.

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
[alto_flute, bass_clarinet, trumpet, violin, cello, double_bass].
Monophony per instrument (no chords).

AGGREGATE (INTERNAL, DO NOT PRINT) — “Aggregate C” for Bars 46–49
Construct a new register-partitioned, non-isomorphic aggregate, different from the one used in Bars 42–45:
• For each instrument, split its playable MIDI range into LOW / MID / HIGH (contiguous, covering the whole range, no gaps).
• Assign disjoint pitch-class sets (pcs) to the three bands so that LOW∪MID∪HIGH = 12 pcs (0..11). Each band has 3–4 pcs and an ORDERED list (thirdal/quartal neighborhoods; avoid trivial 0–3–6–9 cycles).
• Material difference vs Bars 42–45: change the pc→band assignment for at least 6 pitch classes and adjust at least one band boundary per instrument.

SECTION STRUCTURE
Produce FOUR bars in 3/4 (ticks 0..11 each): Bars 46, 47, 48, 49.

PT REALIZATION

Trumpet (triumphant melody — loud, singing line)
• TIME: strictly increasing onsets using only add {1,2,3,4}; no zeros; 4–8 notes per bar (varied across bars).
• DURATION: realized values in {1,2,3,4}; each duration ≤ distance to the next onset (and last note ends ≤ 12).
• PITCH: add/sub only. Compose a melodic through-line across Bars 46–49—motivic development, no copy-paste. Favor MID↔HIGH register. Avoid >3 same-direction steps; net drift per bar in [−2..+2]. Keep pitches strictly inside the hard MIDI range and band-legal pcs.
• VELOCITY: triumphant forte ≈ 108–116 (small local arcs allowed, step deltas ≤ 8). This MUST be clearly louder than all others in these bars.
• METER: seeds set numerator=3, denominator=4; their transforms are constant add 0.

All other instruments (ppp answer-texture, interlocking)
• TIME: strictly increasing using only add {1,2,3,4}; 3–6 notes per bar; avoid heavy alignment with trumpet (≤ 1/3 of their onsets may coincide with trumpet onsets).
• DURATION: realized values in {1,2,3,4}; guarantee monophony with MAX(duration) ≤ s_min where s_min is that instrument’s smallest time step in the bar.
• PITCH: add/sub only within band pcs of Aggregate C; seed near tessitura center; frequent small steps (±1, ±2) with occasional corrective leaps (±5, ±7, ±12) that immediately return to stepwise motion. Stay strictly within the hard MIDI range and band pcs.
• VELOCITY: ppp ≈ 22 (±2) — whisper-soft bed beneath the trumpet.
• METER: seeds numerator=3, denominator=4; transforms add 0.

VARIATION RULES vs the earlier 4×3/4 fragment
• For EACH non-trumpet instrument in EACH bar: the onset set must differ materially from Bars 42–45 (target Jaccard overlap < 0.5); use at least one different duration value per instrument/bar.
• For EACH non-trumpet instrument: step-patterns must not be a literal copy of the earlier fragment—alter at least half the positions.

INTERLOCK & VOICING
• Keep mild rhythmic interlock; adjacent instruments avoid unisons at coincident onsets; sparse octaves OK.
• Maintain registral spacing: db LOW, vc LOW↔MID, bcl LOW↔MID; vn MID, af MID↔HIGH, tpt MID↔HIGH.

VALIDATION
• Exactly four bars of 3/4 (12 ticks each). All time streams strictly increase; no chords.
• For every instrument: durations in {1,2,3,4}; durations fit the gaps; last note ends ≤ 12.
• Pitch add/sub only; inside instrument hard ranges and legal band pcs.
• Dynamics: trumpet ≈ 108–116; all others ppp ≈ 22.
• Seeds set numerator=3, denominator=4 (transforms add 0).
