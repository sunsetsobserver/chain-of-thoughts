METER: 3/4

TITLE
Bar 35 — Literal repeat of Bar 4 (pp/ppp, center-weighted voicing; one bar-long sustain per instrument).

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
[alto_flute, bass_clarinet, trumpet, violin, cello, double_bass]. Everyone plays; monophony only.

PT REALIZATION — one sustained note per instrument
• TIME: exactly one onset at tick 0 (N=1).
• DURATION: 12 (full bar; ends exactly at tick 12).
• PITCH: pick the same (or nearest legal) tessitura-centered MIDI used in Bar 4 for each instrument, legal in the aggregate band at that register; constant through the bar.
• VELOCITY: pp–ppp ≈ 40–48, constant (tiny ±2 OK).
• METER: numerator=3, denominator=4 via seeds; transforms add 0.

VALIDATION
Exactly one note per instrument; ends at tick 12; legal ranges; band-legal pcs; no overlaps.
