METER: 3/4

TITLE
Bars 42–45 — Endgame: four airy “cloud” bars (pp), low density, gentle taper.

INSTRUMENTS (EXACT)
[alto_flute, bass_clarinet, trumpet, violin, cello, double_bass].
Monophony per instrument (no chords).

SECTION POLICY (applies to EACH of Bars 42, 43, 44, 45)
• Dynamic: pp ≈ 28–34 per note.
• Density per instrument per bar:
  – winds/violin/cello: 2–4 notes;
  – trumpet/double_bass: 1–3 notes (sparser).
• TIME: strictly increasing; only add {1,2,3,4}; ≤ ~1/4 of onsets coincide across instruments.
• DURATION: values in {1,2,3,4}; each duration ≤ gap to next onset; no overlaps.
• PITCH: add/sub only within Aggregate C band pcs; seed near tessitura center; net drift per line per bar in [−2..+2]; stay inside hard ranges.
• VELOCITY: stable pp; small stepwise changes (±2 max).
• METER: numerator=3, denominator=4 via seeds; transforms add 0.

OPTIONAL TEXTURAL DETAIL
In at most **one** of the four bars, allow a brief 1–2 tick “flutter” (staccato pair) by **one** instrument only; keep it pp and notate as separate onsets with durations 1–2 and legal spacing (still monophonic, no overlaps).

STRUCTURE OF THE RETURN
Return one JSON object with "bars":[ … ] containing **four** 3/4 bars (ticks 0..11 each),
all following the rules above.

VALIDATION
Per bar & per instrument: monophony; time add {1..4} strictly increasing; last note ends ≤ 12; values of duration in {1,2,3,4}; pitch in range and band pcs; ≤ ~1/4 vertical alignments; optional flutter appears in at most one bar and by only one instrument.
