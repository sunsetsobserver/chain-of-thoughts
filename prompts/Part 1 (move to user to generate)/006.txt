METER: 4/4

TITLE
Bar 6 — Two contrasting half-note chords (A then B) concluding the harmonic material of previous bars 4 and 5.

INSTRUMENTS
Everyone plays, tutti;
[alto_flute, violin, bass_clarinet, trumpet, cello, double_bass].
Only melodic instrument are used, thus polyphony within one instrument's track is not allowed. Write only one note per instrument at the time.

BAR-LEVEL MATERIAL (INTERNAL, DO NOT PRINT)
Define two distinct half-bar pcsets, A (first half, ticks 0–8) and B (second half, ticks 8–16).
Both are subsets of the aggregate’s band pcs; A ≠ B; each size 4–10.
Register targets:

* double_bass: LOW   cello: LOW↔MID   bass_clarinet: LOW↔MID
* violin: MID   alto_flute: MID↔HIGH   trumpet: MID↔HIGH
  Avoid adjacent-instrument unisons; octave doublings OK but sparse.

PT REALIZATION — exactly two half-note chords per instrument
Each instrument plays one chord on tick 0 (pcset A) and one chord on tick 8 (pcset B).
Hard constraints per instrument:
• TIME: two onsets at ticks 0 and 8 (N = 2). No other onsets.
• DURATION: 8 for each note → half-note sustain (0–8, 8–16).
• PITCH: for each half, choose one legal MIDI from the targeted band belonging to the appropriate pcset (A or B).
 Pitch is constant within each half; change between halves (A→B).
• VELOCITY: pcset A ≈ forte (108–116), pcset B ≈ mezzo-forte (88–96). Constant within each half.
• METER: numerator = 4, denominator = 4 via seeds; meter transforms are `add 0`.

ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS
• No re-articulation inside a half bar.
• No extra onsets besides [0, 8].
• No pitch changes within a half-note sustain.

STRUCTURE OF THE RETURN
Return a single JSON object representing Bar 6, realized as a six-instrument bundle with two half-note chords (A and B) within one 4/4 bar.

VALIDATION
• Per instrument: exactly two notes (onsets [0, 8], durations [8, 8]).
• All MIDI values inside hard instrument ranges.
• Chosen pcs legal for bands and pcsets; octave doublings sparse; avoid neighbor unisons.
• Last note ends exactly at tick 16.
