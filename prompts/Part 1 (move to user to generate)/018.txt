[alto_flute, violin, bass_clarinet, trumpet, cello, double_bass]. Everyone plays; monophony per instrument.

PT REALIZATION — two half-note chords per instrument
• TIME: onsets [0, 8] (N=2). No other onsets.
• DURATION: [8, 8].
• PITCH: chord A at tick 0 and chord B at tick 8 matching Bar 6 roles/spacing (or nearest legal); constant within each half.
• VELOCITY: A ≈ 108–116; B ≈ 88–96; constant within halves.
• METER: numerator=4, denominator=4 via seeds; transforms add 0.

VALIDATION
Exactly two notes per instrument; ends exactly at tick 16; ranges and band pcs legal; avoid adjacent-instrument unisons; sparse octaves OK.
