PT REALIZATION — one sustained note per instrument
• TIME: one onset at tick 0 (N=1).
• DURATION: 12 (ends exactly at 12).
• PITCH: choose a legal MIDI near the Bar-4 role/region but reflecting the new aggregate’s band pcs; constant.
• VELOCITY: pp–ppp ≈ 40–48, constant.
• METER: seeds numerator=3, denominator=4; transforms add 0.

VALIDATION
Exactly one note per instrument; ends at tick 12; legal ranges; band-legal pcs; no overlaps.
